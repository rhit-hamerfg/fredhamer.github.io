                I'm Fred Hamer, a Junior Software Engineer and Computer Science double major studying at 
                Rose-Hulman Institue of Technology. I have a passion for solving complex problems, and 
                working on a wide range projects. I've combined my enjoyment of computers and software with
                the Mechanical Engineering world, which is what I plan to minor in. These areas of study 
                complement my intrests in the airline, aerospace, and automotive industries, along with intrest
                in the business and financial sector. I am currently looking for a place to intern in the Summer of
                2024, where I hope to appy my intrests and expertise to contribute to innovative projects.

            My technical background consists of many software languages, mainly but not limited to Java, Python, C,
            HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MATLAB, as well as other softwares such as SolidWorks and Microsoft Office. These
            have allowed me to deploy my expertise on projects such as Genetic Algorithm Research, Video Game Development,
            Motion Planning and Generation for a Robotic Arm, and website development. Signifigant classes I have taken in 
            my cricullium consist of Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis, Web Programming, Computer Architecture, and 
            Object-Oriented Software Development. This education background has allowed me to work on projects online through
            DataAnnotationTech, where I work on training AI models and analyzing code that they produce.
