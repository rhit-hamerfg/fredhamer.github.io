                The replica Pacman game plays just like Pacman and is just as fun! The user starts the game
                and gets thrown into the maze and has to fight for survival! Collect pellets to increase score
                and eventually all of them to beat the level. Be careful though: the ghosts are NOT friendly and
                end the game on contact.

            <p>
                The project required a ghost class which must generate random movements to keep the player on
                edge and guessing where they need to avoid. Contrarily, the Pacman class, operated by the user,
                only allows for movement along one axis at a time, to constrain movement to similar conditions as
                the actual game.
